          computed, then made [complete] and immutable once the summary is fully analyzed. *)

(** Mutable state keeping track during on-demand interprocedural analysis of (1) which procedure is
    currently being analyzed and (2) which procedures type environments were used to compute
    summaries.

    Located here in the IR module to avoid adding parameters threading the currently-under-analysis
    procedure throughout various analysis engine and checker code. These dependencies are then used
    in the Backend module to conservatively invalidate procedure summaries that were computed using
    out-of-date type environment information. *)
