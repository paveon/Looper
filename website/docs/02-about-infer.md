title: About Infer
---

Infer is a static program analyzer for Java, C, C++, Objective-C, and
Erlang, written in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/). Infer is deployed
within Meta and it is running as part of its Continuous Integration
pipeline to verify select properties of every code modification for a
large range of projects, including the main family of apps such as
Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Infer is used at a
number of other companies too. Infer can detect deep issues such as
null pointer dereferences, data races, and many more, which can
involve reasoning about multiple functions or methods in different
files in the code.
